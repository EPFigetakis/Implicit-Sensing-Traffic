# Implementation for Implicit Sensing in Traffic Optimization: Advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning Techniques


This repo covers and replicates the methodology introduced in the paper. 

A quick overview of implementation and contributions from the paper:

> Developed a cohesive decision control framework for car-following and lane-changing operations utilizing DRL techniques.
> 
> Formulated the scenario in an MDP to employ a DQN
>
> Evaluate and contrast two distince decision-making policies, Boltzmann and Epsilon Greedy
>
> Created and integration between OpenAI GYM and SUMO, using TraCI


The proposed solution includes a visual simulation of the SUMO lane changing happening to avoid obstacles in the road. 

Also included is the performance of the different policies.
